# TSPulse Observations

### Config #1: Recipe defaults

Attempting to set a baseline anomaly score for coolant temperature. Should achieve close to 0% anomalies.

Current results:
- Total data points analyzed: 10,000
- Total anomalies detected: 500
- Overall anomaly rate: 5.00%

Coolant Temperature Sensor Results:
- Coolant anomalies detected: 500
- Coolant anomaly rate: 5.00%
- Threshold value: 0.3002
